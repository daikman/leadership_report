# Data visualisations for a report

For my job, I wrote a report based on a survey sent to leaders of various companies. 

This is the source for the visualisations I made using `D3.js`. See and interect with them here: https://daikman.github.io/leadership_report

I wouldn't advise using this code for your own projects, as it's almost definately not the best implementation. It works though! 

I'm using fake data here. If you want to see the real thing, you can find the full report [here](https://emeraldworks.com/research-and-reports/management/leader-perceptions-of-l-and-d)
